<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Background</h1>
<p>Social Media have played an ever-larger role in US Presidential elections. During Howard Dean’s 2004 election bid, campaign manager Joe Trippi leveraged online services, including blogs, to organize a “grassroots” fundraising movement that was surprisingly successful. Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns made extensive use of existing social media platforms - including Facebook - but also developed their own platforms for specific operations like the Dean campaign had. In the lead-up to the 2016 campaign, Eric Schmidt guided the formation of The Groundwork, a team of web specialists who would develop specific expertise for consulting with political campaigns. The 2016 Clinton campaign has, in all likelihood, inherited much of this IT expertise. Less is understood about the 2016 Trump campaign, but it is already clear that Social Media are central to the campaign’s strategy.</p>
<div id="political-advertising-geography-and-hashtags" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Political Advertising, Geography, and Hashtags</h2>
<p>The traditional model of political advertising has derived from social persuasion. The “mere exposure” effect, in which the simple act of seeing a name repeatedly leads to greater liking for that name, accounts for the success of simple poster-style political messaging like lawn signs. However, what was effective several decades ago is now much less effective due to the pervasiveness of media, and in particular, social media.</p>
<p>Voter segmentation is the natural evolution of advertising-oriented political campaigning. Good data and statistical analysis are required for voter segmentation to be effective. Segmentation seems to naturally map onto geographically partitioned federal and state districts, so at first glance, the technique appears to offer great value. What began in the 1970s with nationwide telephone polling has now been perfected by statisticians like Nate Silver to the extent that virtually every district-by-district scenario can be tested for its electoral consequences.</p>
<p>As information technology has overcome geographical distances, geographical segmentation may no longer be the best predictor of political outcomes. The “long tail” dynamics of niche economies are only possible when individuals are aggregated across geographies, not bounded within. A more accurate metaphor for our political reality in 2016 is the chatroom or hashtag, in which people dynamically self-aggregate based solely upon belief. This underlying principle of shared belief signifies the changing political paradigm; advertising becomes psychology.</p>
<p>Social media is an attractive platform for political campaigning. With relatively little expense, it is possible to reach vast online audiences through viral mechanisms of propagation. Viral propagation is itself influenced by the beliefs of the individuals who participate in social media sharing. In this manner, hashtags - not geographical segments - should more closely track to the true beliefs of potential voters. The unit of political analysis shifts from geographical regions to individual online personae.</p>
</div>
<div id="rational-social-media-agents" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Rational Social Media Agents</h2>
<p>One model of social media sharing suitable for individual-level analysis assumes that a rational human controls the social media experience. Imagine you are using social media and you are deciding whether to “like” a political meme. Now imagine this is an economic process, and consider the risks and benefits of “liking” that media. Does your act of liking it reveal your private political beliefs? And so on. Let us refer to this as the Rational Agent model of Social Media, and throughout these analyses we will consider that each “like” appearing in the data was created by Rational Agent.</p>
<p>However, we know the Rational Agent model is simplistic; it was challenged during the 2016 election season when questions were raised about Facebook news curation, Reddit moderation, and Twitter censorship, Google’s ranking algorithm, and so on. While it has long been a trope that “mainstream media” are biased, presumably due to the centralization of publishing power, now the same accusations are being levied at social media platforms. Therefore, certain external forces may influence the very experiences a Rational Agent may encounter, which will influence meme creation and liking rates.</p>
</div>
<div id="bots" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Bots</h2>
<p>Even as social media platforms consolidate power, those platforms have been leveraged by bot networks to increase the quantity of certain messages, alter the visibility of messages, spam comment threads, and vote to influence discussions. Bot networks, just like media platforms, represent the consolidation of control over network messaging. Therefore, our Agent model must allow for malicious actors who generate fake behaviours that are mixed with real behaviours in a way that we cannot distinguish.</p>
<p>The social media landscape is complex and the political battle currently being waged through these media is very messy, resulting in lots of noise in our social media data. Vast quantities of social media “likes” are attributable to non-human agents. With this caveat in mind, the current report looks at data aggregated by Sizzle, an online meme aggregator.</p>
